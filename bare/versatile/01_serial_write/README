The code in this directory tries to document the process of writing a bare
bones application. The hardware used is the A13-OlinuXino_MICRO.

One day I hope to merge it with: http://www.bravegnu.org/gnu-eprog/

The setting is a little different as it doesn't concentrate on assembly
programming itself. It is more of an effort to document and share some of the
tricks I happen to know.

Best to learn would be to first test the code (make run) and go on from there.
perhaps just print the few files and start reading.
